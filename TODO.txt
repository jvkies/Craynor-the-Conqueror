TODO

o implement smarter wayfinding (A star algorithm)
o implement fog of war
o replace citys to capture by keys, and than make a scene change when all keys are collected and a door to the scene change field is unlocked
o implement more unique items
o balance the item drop rate with the spawn rate of mobs (changes with difficulty) to 1 or less items per level
o add visual effect for a level up (maybe text + nice power effect)

TOFIX

o Volume 0 is actually volume 10 (crafty.audio handles volume 0 wrong)
o Volume only affects music volume during scene change (its because we cannot change the volume of a currently playing song)
o Enemys hit you when you destroy the last city and the scene changes happens
